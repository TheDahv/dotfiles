#You Are Looking At My Dotfiles

It's what people do. Also, I'm preparing to jump to a new machine
so this seemed like a good thing to do.

I did borrow much of this from [holman's](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles),
but I thought just reading his structure and copying files on my
system myself would be easier than trying to edit a forked project.

##install
Are you sure you want to install my personal customized stuff? 

If so, this is what you can do:

* `git clone git://github.com/TheDahv/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
* `cd ~/.dotfiles`
* `rake install`
